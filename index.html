      <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

      <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
      learning<em> technical sophistication</em>, probably more. To join our

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
          Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
          share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      <h2>Founders</h2>

      <p>
     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
     Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
     sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
     <em><strong>at least a billion people</strong></em>, and probably more.

      <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

      <p>
        Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
        Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="http://learnenough.com/"> Learn Enough to be Dangerous</a>
        intorductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
        <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
        plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillian
        are slightly exaggerated.

      <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

      <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end developement, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guita with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
        tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
